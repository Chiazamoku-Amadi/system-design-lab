# System Design Lab - by Chiazamoku Amadi

Welcome to my **System Design Lab**. This is a guided journey into the inner workings of scalable, reliable, and performant systems.  
This repository captures my hands-on exploration of **backend architecture and system design**, one challenge at a time.

Each challenge focuses on a core concept of system design and ends with a tangible project - a living artifact that embodies what I’ve learned.  
I’m building these projects using **Node.js**, combining both **theory and implementation** to strengthen my engineering intuition.

## Vision

My goal is to grow from a strong frontend developer into a **world-class fullstack engineer**, one who can:

- Architect systems that scale elegantly under load.
- Make informed trade-offs grounded in data and design principles.
- Build backend services that are both **robust and maintainable**.
- Approach engineering decisions with confidence, clarity, and curiosity.

This lab is where I practice those principles through structured, progressive challenges.

## The Journey Map

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1–3)**

Understanding how systems store, access, and expose data efficiently.

1. **Data Storage & Caching**  
   → Learn how data is stored, accessed, and optimized with caching for performance.  
   _(Involves: in-memory caching, cache invalidation, performance measurement.)_

2. **API Design & REST Principles**  
   → Learn to design clean, well-structured REST APIs that follow best practices and standard conventions.  
   _(Involves: routes, controllers, validation, pagination, filtering, error handling.)_
